Things to learn and do

- 3 topics due next week for research/pres, part of this cna include research for our own project to learn how to open web pages, edit, 
  transfer data from page1 -> page2
  
  James: I need to eventually get both you guys computers setup to begin editing and pushing changes. Give me about a week or 2 
  
  look up using the DOM (document), 
  
    - how data is moved among webpages 
    - how does react launch new webpage and fetch data?
  
  reading/writing the database
  user auth how? is there a javascript library
  look up potentially locking features if bad access is detected (later on)
  
  Form editing ON the webpage with auto-saving data to database/profile
  
  look up file uploading and javascript
 
  look up how JSON works with websites and javascript
   
  Basically, we have a full month to explore web dev and writing to a backend
